        <p class="texClass">This is the first content of Article 1. This course teaches you to make informed decisions by dividing deep into real concepts,
            architecture, and unidirectional dataflow. You will learn how to bootstrap an application and how to
            build pages and reusable elements using Angular components and the new Angular syntax. You
            will also learn about the basics of how Angular works, and why Angular has emerged as a popular
            framework for JavaScript/Typescript application Development. You will also learn how to properly
            setup your development environment for creating an Angular app, including installing VS Code,
            Node.JS, Typescript, and the Angular CLI.</p>
